In this project I have developed an Artificial Intelligent Agent to pose as a Halma player which generates an optimal move when its turn comes. The move generated will maximize the agent's chance of winning the game. 

Halma is a game which is slightly similar to Chinese Checkers.The gameboard is checkered and divided into 16Ã—16 squares. The game is played by two or four players seated at opposing corners of the board. The game is won by being first to transfer all of one's pieces from one's own camp into the camp in the opposing corner.
